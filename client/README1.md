Technologies Used:
Frontend: React.js & Material-UI
Backend: Node.js & Express.js
DataBase: MongoDB

MaterialUI is ReactJS Framework which has inbuilted components.
If we get error while connecting to database then Add you ip in Network Access in mongodb.cloud .

CORS Error ->  By default data should not be transferred from one server to another server. This ins called CORS error.
This is to be solved from backend as backend will provide you the data.
Used Grid Component from MaterialUI to make my website Responsive.

fonts.google.com -> To take Roboto Font from there.
Import file in index.css

We don't hv to push node modules of our Frontend,bcoz we do npm install there on heroku.

 cd server
 heroku login
 git init
 git status
 git add .
 git commit -m "v2.0.4"
 heroku create asu-999
